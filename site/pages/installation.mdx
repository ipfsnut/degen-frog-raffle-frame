# Installation

Install Frog via your package manager or build from source.

## Package Manager

Install the required packages.

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add frog hono
```

```bash [npm]
npm install frog hono
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add frog hono
```

```bash [bun]
bun add frog hono
```
:::

- [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono) is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) is optional, but highly recommended.

## Using Unreleased Commits

If you can't wait for a new release to test the latest features, you can either install from the `canary` tag (tracks the [`main`](https://github.com/wevm/frog/tree/main) branch).

:::code-group
```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add frog@canary
```

```bash [npm]
npm install frog@canary
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add frog@canary
```

```bash [bun]
bun add frog@canary
```
:::

Or clone the [Frog repo](https://github.com/wevm/frog) to your local machine, build, and link it yourself.

```bash
gh repo clone wevm/frog
cd frog
pnpm install
pnpm build
cd src
pnpm link --global
```

Then go to the project where you are using Frog and run `pnpm link --global frog` (or the package manager that you used to link Frog globally). Make sure you installed the [required peer dependencies](/installation#package-manager) and their versions are correct.

## Security

Ethereum-related projects are often targeted in attacks to steal users' assets. Make sure you follow security best-practices for your project. Some quick things to get started.

- Pin package versions, upgrade mindfully, and inspect lockfile changes to minimize the risk of [supply-chain attacks](https://nodejs.org/en/guides/security/#supply-chain-attacks).
- Install the [Socket Security](https://socket.dev) [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/socket-security) to help detect and block supply-chain attacks.
- Add a [Content Security Policy](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html) to defend against external scripts running in your app.
