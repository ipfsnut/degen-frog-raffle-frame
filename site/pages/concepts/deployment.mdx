# Deployment

**Frog** is designed so that you can deploy it to any deployment target that supports a JavaScript runtime.

Such targets include:

- [Bun](/platforms/bun)
- [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers)
- [Next.js](/platforms/next)
- [Node.js](/platforms/node)
- [Vercel](/platforms/vercel)

## Which Deployment Target?

You may be wondering what deployment target is best for you and the application you are building.

- If you are building a **standalone frame application**, then maybe using [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) 
or [Vercel Serverless Functions](/platforms/vercel) may be the best option for you.

- If you are building **frames embedded in a Next.js application**, then maybe using the 
[Next.js](/platforms/next) deployment target is the best option for you. 

- If you are building **frames embedded in another type of web application**, you could create an `/api` folder
in your repository and use [Cloudflare Workers](/platforms/cloudflare-workers) or [Vercel Serverless Functions](/platforms/vercel) (and deploy them
in isolation to the app). This is what [we are doing](https://github.com/wevm/frog/tree/main/services/auth) for the Devtools Auth Service.
